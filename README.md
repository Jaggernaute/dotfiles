# Dotfiles

*Configuration files for my GNU/Linux system.*

I currently use `Qtile` as my Desktop Environment, but I am still configuring it.

So, for now, I have a side configuration for `KDE Plasma`.
I use `KDE` in a Xephyr window when necessary, but I use `Qtile` in the main screen.

## Organization

All configuration files are stored in the `src` directory.

It contains 4 subdirectories:

- `apps` contains configuration files for applications.
- `desktop` contains configuration files for the desktop environment.
- `extra` contains configuration files for other things.
- `themes` contains configuration files for themes (like gtk).

You can also find extra configuration files in the `src/extra` directory.
